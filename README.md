This is currently a derisking project which will stop after a very minimal mvp.

Synthizer needs a way to write effects that doesn't drive me insane, and all languages for audio processing that I'm
aware of don't meet all my needs (in particular, being able to JIT so that people can write custom effects, targeting
performance first, fully branchless when possible, simd...).
